## Settings

To change the settings of this app, you can open **PDF on Submit Settings** via the search bar.

- Choose active DocTypes

  Here you can select for which DocTypes this app is active. DocTypes that are disabled will be ignored.

- Create PDF in Background

    Enable this option if you want to continue your work immediately. The PDFs will just appear once they are created. (This might require a reload of the current document.) Recommended if you usually submit many sales documents in bulk.
    
    Disable this option to get the PDF immediately. When you submit the document you will see a progress bar while the PDF gets created. When it's done you immediately see the PDF attached to the document.
